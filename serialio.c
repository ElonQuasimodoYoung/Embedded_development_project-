/*
 * FILE: serialio.c
 *
 * Written by Peter Sutton.
 * 
 * Module to allow standard input/output routines to be used via 
 * serial port 0. The init_serial_stdio() method must be called before
 * any standard IO methods (e.g. printf). We use interrupt-based output
 * and a circular buffer to store output messages. (This allows us 
 * to print many characters at once to the buffer and have them 
 * output by the UART as speed permits.) If the buffer fills up, the
 * put method will either
 * (1) if interrupts are enabled, block until there is room in it, or
 * (2) if interrupts are disabled, will discard the character.
 * Input is blocking - requesting input from stdin will block
 * until a character is available. If interrupts are disabled when 
 * input is sought, then this will block forever.
 * The function input_available() can be used to test whether there is
 * input available to read from stdin.
