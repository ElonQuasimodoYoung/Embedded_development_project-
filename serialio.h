 * Module to allow standard input/output routines to be used via 
 * serial port 0. The init_serial_stdio() method must be called before
 * any standard IO methods (e.g. printf). We use interrupt-based serial
 * IO and a circular buffer to store output messages. (This allows us 
 * to print many characters at once to the buffer and have them 
 * output by the UART as speed permits.) Interrupts must be enabled 
 * globally for this module to work (after init_serial_stdio() is called).
